title: scylarmartin summer python first reflection
There is a lot of information covered in the chapter 2. I had no difficulty to read the study material and only
struggled a litte bit on the "input section". However, understanding and practicing are differernt. I got stucled on the very
first problem. I did not understand the "input" operations. I googled online and found something called raw input in python 2
that can include the "enter your name" in the code and only print the name inputed. Then i get to know that in python 3, the raw_input
turn out to be the "input" operation in the reading. i rerun the code and stucked at the "enter your name", but not "hello, your name" 
in the right column. It took me about 20 minute to realize that I can interact with the right column. Actually the right column is 
where I should type the name in, instead of the left column. In the second problem, I got stucked on the final step of caculating the pay.
I did not define the hour and pay as a float variables. The third problem becomes easier based on the knowledge I have from the previous
two. The only problem I encounter is that I cannot get the right result when I try to print "The converted Farenheit tem is + "Farenheit"".
Something goes wrong but I still did figure it out. So i seperate the operate into two. Print(the converted tem) and print(farenheit). 
In addition, I also have to remind me and check if I use the right symbol. Now I feel the same way as the reading mentioned, coding is 
similiar to the actual language, we need to practice frequently to understand and use them.
